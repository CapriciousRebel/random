COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered high.

This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians.

There is an increased risk of more severe outcomes for Canadians aged 65 and over, with compromised immune systems
and with underlying medical conditions. There are also increased health risks for Canadian travellers abroad.
