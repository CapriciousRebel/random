In The Face Of Coronavirus, Canadians Are Stepping Up To Help.

In any situation, no matter how dire, people will try to help.

As the rates of coronavirus continue to surge, many Canadians are gripped with panic. But across the country, there are people who are jumping into action to help wherever they can.

For someX, the choice to help came last week, when local food banks made the announcement that they were almost out of supplies. People had already started panic-shopping, taking up most of the local supply of non-perishables and toilet paper, leaving little for the communityâ€™s most vulnerable, who rely on food banks.

A store started offering a promotion, offering free earrings to anyone who dropped off a food donation. It did not take long for the idea to take off. Another person offered to help seniors pick up groceries, medicine, or other essentials.

For someY, the decision to help came from the realization that she did not really know a lot of her neighbours. As someone who knew she was young and healthy, she wanted to provide support to the people around her who were more vulnerable, but did not have a clear sense of who those people were.
